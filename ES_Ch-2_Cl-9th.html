<strong>III. Answer the following questions describing your strengths and weakness.</strong><br> 

<strong>1. What is your greatest strength?<br> 
Answer:</strong><br> 
My greatest strength is my dedication and sincerity toward my work. I always try to complete my tasks on time with full responsibility. I am also a quick learner and always eager to improve myself, which helps me adapt to new situations and technologies easily.
<br> 
<strong>2. What is your greatest weakness?<br> 
Answer:</strong><br> 
My greatest weakness is that I sometimes take on too many responsibilities at once, trying to help everyone. While my intention is to support the team, it can occasionally affect my own time management. However, I’m learning to prioritize tasks better and delegate when necessary to maintain balance and efficiency.
<br> 
<strong>3. Which activity do you find hard to resist?<br> 
Answer:</strong><br> 
I find it hard to resist helping someone who truly needs support, especially in learning or solving a problem. Whether it’s a student struggling with a concept or a colleague needing assistance, I feel naturally drawn to help them.
<br> 
<strong>4. What is your nature like?<br> 
Answer:</strong><br> 
I have a calm, patient, and friendly nature. I enjoy working with others, listening to their views, and helping when needed. I stay positive even in difficult situations and try to maintain a peaceful and cooperative environment around me.<br> 

<strong>5. What would you do to overcome your greatest weakness?<br> 
Answer:</strong><br> 
To overcome my greatest weakness of taking on too many tasks at once, I have started practicing better time management and setting clear priorities. I now make to-do lists, break big tasks into smaller steps, and remind myself that it’s okay to say no or ask for help when needed.
<br> 
<strong>6. Which thing makes you angry?<br> 
Answer:</strong><br> 
I usually try to stay calm, but I feel upset when I see unfair behavior, especially when someone is disrespected or treated unjustly. I believe everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, and such situations make me feel strongly about standing up for what’s right.      
      <p> <strong>7. What do you find most challenging in your day-to-day life?<br> 
      Answer:</strong><br> 
        The most challenging part of my day-to-day life is balancing multiple responsibilities at the same time. Managing work, personal tasks, and self-improvement can be difficult, but I try to stay organized and focused by planning my day and staying disciplined with my time.
