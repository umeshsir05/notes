        Answer-</strong><br>
        Environmental pollution is one of the most serious problems the world is facing today. It refers to the contamination of the natural environment, including air, water, and soil. Pollution is mainly caused by human activities such as industrialization, deforestation, and the use of plastic and chemicals. Air pollution leads to respiratory problems, while water pollution harms aquatic life and affects drinking water. Soil pollution reduces agricultural productivity. If pollution continues to increase, it will have dangerous effects on the health of humans, animals, and plants. To control pollution, we must use eco-friendly products, plant more trees, reduce waste, and spread awareness. Every individual must take responsibility to protect the environment for future generations.<br><br>

        and (joins similar ideas): I bought apples and bananas.<br>
        but (shows contrast): He is poor but honest.<br>
        because (shows reason): I am late because of the traffic.<br><br>
