    <strong>5. What role does gender stereotyping play in the development of self-confidence?<br>Answer – </strong><br>
    At times certain cultures discriminate against girls and consider them as inferior to male children. Girls from such cultures will surely have lower levels of self-esteem and self-confidence than girls coming from a non-discriminatory culture.<br><br>

    <strong>6. What is the importance of finding your unique qualities and using them to develop your confidence?<br>Answer:</strong><br>
    Finding your unique qualities helps you understand your strengths and abilities. When you recognize what makes you special, you begin to trust yourself more. Using these qualities in your daily life builds self-confidence because you feel capable and proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <strong>7. How can you overcome set-backs with self-confidence?<br>Answer:</strong><br>
    You can overcome setbacks with self-confidence by staying positive, learning from your mistakes, and not giving up. Believing in your ability to improve and try again helps you move forward. Self-confidence gives you the strength to face challenges and grow from them.<br><br>

    <strong>8. Can you yourself build your own confidence or do you need someone else to do it for you?<br>Answer:</strong><br>
    You can build your own confidence by setting small goals, celebrating achievements, and learning from experiences. While others can support or motivate you, real confidence comes from within. It grows when you believe in yourself and keep trying, even when it’s hard.
