<strong>III. Short Answer Questions.</strong><br><br>
<strong>1. What do you understand by the Frame style in LibreOffice Writer?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
In LibreOffice Writer, Frame Style refers to predefined formatting settings applied to frames—movable containers that hold text, images, or other objects. Frame styles control properties like size, position, borders, background, and text wrapping. They help maintain consistent design throughout the document. Users can apply or customize frame styles for tasks such as image captions or sidebars. This feature is especially useful for creating structured layouts in newsletters, brochures, or multi-column documents efficiently and uniformly.<br><br>

<strong>2. What do you understand by Styles in context of the LibreOffice Writer word processor?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
In a word processor, a style is a set of text formatting characteristics, such as font size, color, and alignment which can be applied to a paragraph or any other selected piece of text in a document Styles help in giving a consistent look to a document and also make is easier to apply major formatting changes to a document. For example, you can make the font of all headers/footers in your document of a specific type just by clicking on a related style option.<br><br>

<strong>3. Differentiate between Paragraph styles and Character Styles.<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
Paragraph styles in LibreOffice Writer format entire paragraphs, controlling alignment, spacing, and indentation. Character styles apply only to selected text, affecting font, size, color, or emphasis like bold or italic. While paragraph styles define the document’s structure, character styles are used for highlighting specific words without altering the overall layout.<br><br>

<strong>4. How will you filter the styles visible in the Styles deck?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
To filter styles in the Styles deck of LibreOffice Writer, open the Styles deck using F11. Use the drop-down menu at the top to choose options like All Styles, Applied Styles, or Custom Styles. This helps display only the relevant styles for easier formatting and document management.<br><br>

<strong>5. Describe the Fill format mode in LibreOffice Writer.<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
You can use the Fill format mode to apply a style to many areas quickly in your document, without having to go back to the Styles deck and double click the style every time. This method is very useful to format scattered text (paragraphs, words) and other elements with the same style. This also saves you from making multiple selections and then applying a same style to format them all.<br><br>

<strong>6. How will you apply a Paragraph Style from the Styles deck to a paragraph?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
To apply a Paragraph Style from the Styles deck in LibreOffice Writer, place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph you want to format. Open the Styles deck by pressing F11, click on the Paragraph Styles icon, then double-click the desired style. The paragraph will immediately adopt the selected style.<br>
<strong><br>

7. What is the use of the Load Styles option?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
The Load Styles option in LibreOffice Writer allows you to import styles (like paragraph, character, frame, or page styles) from another document or template. It helps maintain consistency across documents by reusing formatting styles without recreating them manually, making document formatting faster, uniform, and more efficient.<br><br>

Answer-</strong><br>
In LibreOffice Writer, Paragraph, Character, Frame, Page, and List styles can be modified using the Styles deck. However, Table styles cannot be modified directly. Manual formatting and styles from read-only documents also can’t be changed through the Styles deck, making them limited in terms of customization and control.<br><br>

<strong>10. What is the use of the New Style from Selection option in Style actions menu?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
The New Style from Selection option in LibreOffice Writer’s Style actions menu allows you to create a new style based on the formatting of selected text or a paragraph. It saves the current formatting (like font, size, color, spacing) as a reusable style, helping maintain consistency in the document.<br>
<strong><br>

1.Page Wrap keeps the image fixed on the page with text wrapping on one side.
2.Optimal Page Wrap also fixes the image, but allows text to wrap on both sides, giving a more balanced and natural layout in the document.<br>
<strong><br>

Answer-</strong><br>
