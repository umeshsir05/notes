    <strong>II. Fill in the blanks to complete the following sentences:</strong><br><br>
    
    1. The <strong><u>Non specific</u></strong> feedback is a type of feedback that doesn't provide detailed or precise responses.<br>
    2. Effective feedback ensures <strong><u>effective</u></strong> communication.<br>
    3. The <strong><u>feedback</u></strong> is considered as the final step in the communication cycle.<br>
    4. The medium by which a message is sent is called the <u><strong>channel</strong></u> of communication.<br>
    5. Any disturbance or interference in the communication process is called<u><strong> noise. </strong></u><strong></strong><br>
    6. The feedback that is given continuously throughout the year is called the <u><strong>formative</strong></u> feedback.<br><br>
    
    <strong>III. Short Answer Questions.</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>1. Briefly explain the communication cycle.<br>
    Answer-</strong><br> The communication cycle is the process of exchanging information or a message between a sender and a receiver, using both verbal and nonverbal methods. The process begins with the sender, who decides what the message is, how it will be relayed and which medium is the best way to share the message. The communication cycle has seven elements:Sender, message, encoding, channel, receiver, decoding and feedback. <br><br>
    
    <strong>2. Why is feedback so important in the process of communication?<br>
    Answer-</strong><br>Feedback is vital in communication as it ensures message clarity, promotes two-way interaction, and strengthens relationships. It builds trust, encourages positive behaviour, and highlights areas for improvement. Feedback enhances learning, boosts performance, and keeps communication effective and goal-oriented. Constructive feedback, when specific and actionable, helps maintain understanding and drives progress in both personal and professional settings.<br><br>
    
    
    <strong>3. What do you understand by specific and non-specific feedbacks?<br>
    Answer-</strong><br>
    Specific feedback gives clear, detailed information about performance, helping individuals understand what they did well or need to improve. For instance, praising the structure and facts in an essay is specific and supports growth. Non-specific feedback, like simply saying “Well done,” lacks explanation and doesn't guide improvement. Effective feedback is based on observed facts and helps shape thinking and behaviour, making specific feedback far more useful than general or vague responses.<br><br>
    
    
    <strong>4. What is the difference between formative feedback and summative feedback?<br>
    Answer-</strong><br>
    Feedback can be formative, meaning it is given continuously during a task or over a session to help ensure progress and correct mistakes. It helps monitor how well someone is performing while the task is ongoing. 
    Summative feedback, on the other hand, is given at the end of a task or year. It evaluates overall performance against set criteria and is used to reward good work or address poor performance.<br><br>
    
    
    <strong>5. Give one example each of the positive and negative feedback.<br>
    Answer-</strong><br>
    Positive feedback highlights what was done well. For example: “Your project was well-researched and clearly presented. Excellent work!”
    Negative feedback points out areas needing improvement. For example: “Your assignment lacked structure and had many spelling mistakes. Please review it carefully next time.”
    Both types of feedback help in improving performance when given constructively and respectfully.<br><br>
    
    
    <strong>6. Give any two features of an effective feedback.<br>
    Answer-</strong><br>
    Effective feedback ensures effective communication. For feedback to be effective it should be clear, meaningful, and actionable. Two features of an effective feedback are - <br>
    1.Be specific: Feedback should be concrete and relate to a specific, measurable goal.<br>
    2.Be descriptive: Feedback should be descriptive and focused on behaviour, not personality or judgment.<br><br>
