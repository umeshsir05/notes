<strong>II. Fill in the blanks.</strong><br>
1.The <u><strong>Standard</strong></u> toolbar displays icons to perform most common operations while working in Calc.<br>
2.<u><strong>Formulas</strong></u> are mathematical expressions to perform calculations on data.<br>
3.<u><strong>Data analysis </strong></u>is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the aim of deriving useful information from it.<br>
4.The feature that allows us to put together data from various locations within a spreadsheet at one place is called<u><strong> Consolidation</strong></u>.<br>
5. The <u><strong>Solver </strong></u>tool is nothing but a more elaborate form of the Goal Seek.<br>
6. The <strong><u>Goal Seek</u></strong> feature determines input values needed to achieve a specific goal.<br>

13. Clicking on the Tools → Scenario option from the menu bar opens up the <u><strong>Create Scenario</strong></u> dialog box.<br>
14. The <u><strong>Subtotals</strong></u> feature allows us to divide data into groups so that it can be easily viewed and analyzed.<br>
15. We use the <u><strong>PMT()</strong></u> function to calculate EMIs on a loan amount.<br><br>

<strong>III. Short Answer Questions. </strong><br><br>
<strong>1.Differentiate between a worksheet and a workbook (or spreadsheet).<br>
Answer -</strong><br>
•	Worksheet: A sheet (or Worksheet) is a grid of numerous rectangular boxes arranged in horizontal rows and vertical columns. <br>
•	Workbook: A workbook in calc is also referred to as a spreadsheet. It is a file that we open in LibreOffice calc to do our work.<br><br> 

<strong>2.What is data sorting in Calc? How will you arrange data in an ascending order in the worksheet?<br>
Answer –</strong><br> 
Sorting data means arranging it in a particular order. Arranging data in a worksheet in a particular order (like a ascending order or descending order) allows us to find desired data entries quickly. <br>
•	Steps for Ascending Order: <br>
1.	Select the data range.<br>
2.	Click Sort Ascending button on the Standard toolbar. <br><br>

<strong>3.What is AutoFilter? What is its utility?<br>
Answer - </strong><br>
•	AutoFilter: A feature that allows you to filter and display only the rows that meet certain criteria.<br>
•	Utility: Quickly hides unwanted data and shows only relevant information.<br><br>

<strong>4. What is data analysis in the context of a spreadsheet program?<br>
Answer –</strong><br>
Data Analysis as a process of Inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the aim of deriving useful information from it, which can further be used in an organization’s decision making process. <br><br>

<strong>5. What is data consolidation? Can it be implemented on multiple sheets?<br>
Answer -</strong><br>
Data consolidate is a feature that allows us to consolidate or put together data from various locations within a spreadsheet or from multiple spreadsheet, at one place. <br>
Yes, it can be implemented on multiple sheets using Data → Consolidate.<br><br>

<strong>6. Differentiate between the Goal Seek and Solver features.<br>
Answer - </strong><br>
•	Goal Seek: Finds the required input value to achieve a specific goal in one cell.<br>
•	Solver: A more advanced tool that adjusts multiple variables to achieve the desired result.<br><br>

<strong>7. What is meant by What-If analysis? List three types of What-If analysis tools available in Calc.<br>
Answer –</strong><br> 
The “what if” analysis is a powerful feature in calc and a many other spreadsheet programs. During ‘what if’ analysis we change the values in cells to see how this changes will affect the outcome of a formula on the worksheet. <br>
<strong>•	Types of What if analysis are</strong> : Goal Seek, Scenario, Data Table.<br><br>

<strong>8. What is the scenario tool? Discuss in brief.<br>
Answer -</strong><br>
A Scenario is a set of values that calc saves for a group of cells. Whenever we run a scenario Calc automatically substitutes the saved cell values into a connected formula to give us an output. <br><br>

<strong>9. How will you open the Navigator to work with scenarios?<br>
Answer - </strong><br>
To open navigator, click on the view menu and from the drop down list select the navigator option.<br><br>
 
<strong>10. How do we track values in a scenario?<br>
Answer –</strong><br> 
To learn which values in the scenario affect other values choose Tool → Detective → Trace Dependents. <br><br>

<strong>11. What do you understand by data filtering? How many types of filters are there in Calc?<br>
Answer –</strong><br> 
When a Sheet contains a large amount of data, it can be difficult to find information quickly. In  that case filter can be used to narrow down the data in your worksheet allowing you to view only the information you need. <br>
•	Types of filters - <br>
1.	Standard Filter<br>
2.	AutoFilter<br>
3.	Advanced Filter<br><br>

<strong>12. What does the Calc’s Subtotal feature help us to do?<br>
Answer – </strong><br>
The Subtotal  feature creates a summarized outline of data in a worksheet. It allows us to divide data into groups so that it can be easily viewed and analyzed. <br>
