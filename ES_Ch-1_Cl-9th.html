  <strong>1. What is communication? Give an example.<br>
    Answer </strong>-<br> 
        Communication means the exchange of ideas and information through speech, writing, gestures or some other means. The term communication skills refers to  those skills which are needed to communicate effectively. For example – A teacher communicates with students to share knowledge and information.  </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>2. What is the communication cycle?<br>
        Answer -</strong><br> 
        Usually communication is a two-way process where information is transmitted from a sender to a receiver. In this process, both the sender and receiver can respond to each other. This leads to a cyclic process known as the communication cycle.
        A communication cycle begins with the sender who wants to transmit an idea, opinion or other information to the receiver and ends with the receiver's feedback to the sender.        </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>3. What is the importance of communication? Write any three points.<br>
        Answer -</strong><br> 
        Communication drives human progress by enabling knowledge sharing across generations. Today, strong communication skills are essential for success and collaboration.
        • Convey Information: Share facts, ideas, and updates clearly.
        • Influence Others: Persuade or motivate people positively.
        • Express Feelings: Share emotions and build connections.
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. What is verbal communication? Give an example.<br>
        Answer –</strong><br> 
        Verbal communication is a type of communication in which we pass on messages through the use of spoken or written words. Accordingly there are two types of verbal communication oral and written. For example-face to face conversation, phone calls, letters, email 
        .</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>5. How does oral communication differ from written communication?<br>
        Answer -</strong><br> 
        Oral communication means speaking with others face-to-face or on calls. It's quick and allows instant feedback. Written communication involves writing messages in letters, emails, or texts. It takes more time but can be saved for future use. Both are important and used in different situations depending on need.  </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>6. What is non-verbal communication? Explain giving an example.<br>
        Answer - </strong><br>
        Non-verbal communication takes place without speaking or writing any words. It happens through facial expressions, touch, posture, eye contact, body language, and hand gestures. Non-verbal communication is used in situations where verbal communication is not possible or not required. Examples include a thumbs-up, a thumbs-down, shrugging shoulders, and other gestures we use in daily life as part of non-verbal communication.  </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>7. What is visual communication?<br>
        Answer -</strong><br> 
        Visual communication refers to communication through pictorial or visual representation of information. In visual communication information is in the form visual elements that can be seen and read by the receiver. Signboards, maps, pictures, displays, charts, graphs, television programs, hoardings, banners, etc. are a few examples of visual communication.  </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>8. What is meant by perspective?<br>
        Answer - </strong><br>
        A particular attitude towards something or a fixed way of thinking about something is called a perspective. Sometimes our perspectives about something or someone affect our communication. For example, suppose you have a fixed idea that your father is strict. If he says something to you very normally, you may think-that he may be scolding you even though he is not.      </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>9. Name any four factors that affect our perspective on communication.<br>
        Answer – </strong><br>
        There are four factors that affecting our perspective - 
        1. Language: Unfamiliar words or different native languages can create barriers in communication.
        2. Visual Perception: People interpret visuals differently based on their perspectives.
        3. Past Experience: Previous experiences can influence current understanding and reactions.
        4. Prejudice: Fixed beliefs may stop open communication.      </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>10. What is a prejudice? How does it affect our perspective of communication?<br>
        Answer -</strong><br>
