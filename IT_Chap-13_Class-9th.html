<strong>3. Why looking at the keyboard to find keys is not allowed in touch typing?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
Looking at the keyboard during touch typing is not allowed because it reduces speed, accuracy, and focus. It breaks the typing flow and prevents the development of muscle memory. Touch typing relies on practicing key positions by feel, allowing the eyes to stay on the screen for better efficiency and fewer errors.<br><br>

    <td>Net CPM</td>
    <td>The CPM without characters with errors. </td>
    <td>Net CPM = CPM - (Characters with errors / Time spent in minutes)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>KPM</td>
    <td>The number of keystrokes in a one minute period of time. </td>
    <td>KPM = (Keystrokes without errors + Keystrokes with errors)/Time spent in minutes. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Net KPM</td>
    <td>The number of keystrokes in a one minute period of time. </td>
    <td>KPM = (Keystrokes without errors + Keystrokes with errors)/Time spent in minutes. </td>
  </tr>

<strong>10. How can we calculate the net typing speed of a person?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
Net typing speed is the number of correct words typed per minute. It is calculated by subtracting errors from total words typed, then dividing by time in minutes.
Formula:
Net WPM = WPM - (Words with errors / Time spent in minutes)<br><br>

<strong>11. What is meant by accuracy in typing? How is the typing accuracy calculated?<br>
Answer-</strong><br>
Typing accuracy refers to how correctly a person types without making errors. It is the percentage of correctly typed characters or words compared to the total number of characters or words typed. High accuracy means fewer mistakes while typing.<br><br>

<strong>12. What is the importance of maintaining rhythm in timing?<br>
Answer-
</strong><br>
In touch typing techniques, the typing rhythm is very important . Typing Rhythm means the keystrokes should come at equal intervals . To control the constant typing speed, the slowdown indicator is used. <br><br><br>
