Water contains ions that conduct electricity, so pouring it on an electrical fire can cause electric shock. It may also create short circuits, increasing heat and spreading the fire further. Therefore, only non-conductive extinguishers like CO₂ or dry powder should be used.<br><br>

4.How do carbon dioxide based fire extinguishers work?<br>
